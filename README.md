## About Me

I am David, 26 years old and living in Stuttgart, Germany.
I am a quite low experienced developer and am excited about getting to know more and more about web development.
My GitHub experience starts with this repository and I am curious about all the fancy features GitHub has to offer.

Currently I work part time as a bartender to finance my career as a self employed web developer which I, hopefully, will be one day.
In my freetime I do alot with friends, playing boardgames or the best Mario Kart ever released: Mario Kart Double Dash!

### Some things I like are:
- Food, especially candy
- Discussions about philosophical opinions
- Discussions in general
- Reading fantasy novels or comics
- Taking a walk in the nature
